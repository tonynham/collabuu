## üîÑ CORE PLATFORM FLOW

The following outlines the complete user journey that the API endpoints must support:

### **Step 1**: Business Creates Campaign
- Business creates campaign via `POST /api/business/campaigns` (with campaign type and visibility)
- Campaign types: Pay Per Customer, Pay Per Post, Media Event
- Visibility: Public (discoverable) or Private (invite-only)
- Public campaigns automatically appear in influencer opportunities
- Private campaigns only accessible via direct invites

### **Step 2**: Influencer Discovery & Application
- Influencer browses PUBLIC opportunities via `GET /api/influencer/opportunities`
- Influencer applies via `POST /api/influencer/opportunities/{id}/apply`
- **Applied campaign moves to influencer's campaigns list with "Pending" status**
- **OR** Business directly invites influencer to PRIVATE campaigns via `POST /api/business/influencers/{id}/invite`
- **Withdrawal Option**: Influencer can withdraw pending applications via `POST /api/influencer/campaigns/{id}/withdraw`
- Withdrawn campaigns return to opportunities list and influencer can reapply
- Media Events can have shared credit pools instead of individual payments

### **Step 3**: Campaign Acceptance & Messaging Enabled
- Business accepts application via `POST /api/business/campaigns/{id}/applications/{applicationId}/accept`
- **OR** Influencer accepts invite via `POST /api/influencer/invites/{inviteId}/accept`
- Accepted campaign moves to influencer's active campaigns
- **Messaging automatically enabled** between business and influencer for this campaign

- Business scans QR code via `POST /api/business/visits/verify`
- Business approves visit via `POST /api/business/visits/approve`

### **Step 7**: Credit & Loyalty Point Allocation
- **Pay Per Customer**: Customer earns loyalty points, influencer gets credits per verified visit

- Loyalty points are deducted from customer balance
- Redeemed reward is added to customer favorites with QR code
- Customer visits business and presents reward QR code
- Business scans QR code via `POST /api/business/rewards/scan`
- Business validates and applies reward via `POST /api/business/rewards/{redemptionId}/validate`
- Reward marked as completed and removed from active favorites

### **Step 9**: Campaign Completion & Messaging Restriction
- When campaign status changes to "completed", "cancelled", or "expired"
- Messaging between business and influencer is automatically disabled

## üí¨ MESSAGING RESTRICTIONS & IMPLEMENTATION

### Core Messaging Rules
‚Ä¢ **Campaign-Based Only**: Messages only allowed between business and influencer when they have an active approved campaign together
‚Ä¢ **Automatic Creation**: Conversation automatically created when campaign is accepted/approved
‚Ä¢ **Automatic Termination**: Messaging disabled when campaign status becomes completed/cancelled/expired
‚Ä¢ **Read-Only Archive**: Past conversations remain visible but no new messages allowed
‚Ä¢ **Multi-Campaign**: Business and influencer can have multiple active conversations if collaborating on multiple campaigns

### Database Schema Requirements
```sql
-- Enhanced conversations table
CREATE TABLE conversations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  business_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  influencer_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  campaign_id UUID REFERENCES campaigns(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, -- Required
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true, -- Auto-updated based on campaign status
  last_message_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  business_read_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  influencer_read_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_conversations_business ON conversations(business_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_conversations_influencer ON conversations(influencer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_conversations_campaign ON conversations(campaign_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_conversations_active ON conversations(is_active);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_conversations_unique ON conversations(business_id, influencer_id, campaign_id);

-- Trigger to update conversation status when campaign status changes
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_conversation_status()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE conversations 
  SET is_active = CASE 
    WHEN NEW.status IN ('completed', 'cancelled', 'expired') THEN false
    WHEN NEW.status = 'active' THEN true
    ELSE is_active
  END
  WHERE campaign_id = NEW.id;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER conversation_status_trigger
  AFTER UPDATE OF status ON campaigns
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_conversation_status();
```

### API Implementation Details
‚Ä¢ **Message Send Validation**: Check `is_active` and campaign status before allowing message creation
‚Ä¢ **Conversation List**: Only return conversations with `is_active = true`
‚Ä¢ **Archive Access**: Separate endpoint for viewing past conversations (read-only)
‚Ä¢ **Status Checks**: Real-time validation of messaging permissions before each action

### Frontend Implementation
‚Ä¢ **Message Input**: Disable/hide message input when conversation becomes inactive
‚Ä¢ **Visual Indicators**: Show "Campaign Completed - Messaging Disabled" banner
‚Ä¢ **Archive View**: Clearly distinguish between active and archived conversations
‚Ä¢ **Automatic Updates**: Listen to campaign status changes to update messaging UI
